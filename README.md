# Vehicle-Efficiency-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This work uses machine learning algorithms to  predict the mpg value of a vehicle based on attributes like  acceleration, weight, displacement, and engine type. Based  on the mpg value and compared with the optimum value the  user or concerned authorities can reach the conclusion to  discard the vehicle or not.

The performance analysis and efficiency of a vehicle play a prominent role and a very necessary step to do in 
today's scenario. There are various instances when the user feels reluctant to discard the vehicle. In such cases where the user is ignorant of the fact to discard the car, the concerned authorities must come forward to check whether the user is using the car beyond the limit. Therefore, there is an increasing need to save the environment and nature to live a sustainable life. The performance analysis of the car is based on the engine type, number of engine cylinders, fuel type, etc.
This study predicts the mpg value by using machine learning models like Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XG-Boost, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, etc. and based on that it is compared with the optimum value of mpg and hence one can reach to a decision to discard the vehicle.
