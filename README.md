# Vehicle-Efficiency-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This work uses machine learning algorithms to  predict the mpg value of a vehicle based on attributes like  acceleration, weight, displacement, and engine type. Based  on the mpg value and compared with the optimum value the  user or concerned authorities can reach the conclusion to  discard the vehicle or not.
